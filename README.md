# Lightshow - It's Lit

This is a project created by Peter Cheung, Marc Hipona, and Francis Jacaban during DragonHacks 2016 at Drexel University.

This is an LED light show created using an Arduino Uno, 10 LED Lights, a 8 ohm speaker, and a Grove LCD RGB Backlight.
 
The original idea was to create a light show "Playlist" consisting of several different light patterns. Each pattern plays continuously until a button is pressed, signaling the next pattern. Later, we incorporated different elements, including a speaker which played the "Mario Theme song" while displaying led patterns that lit up to the different notes being played.

The code is created completely in Arduino Sketches.
